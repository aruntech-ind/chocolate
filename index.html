<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
    Cadbury Dairy Milk is a British brand of milk chocolate manufactured by Cadbury, first introduced in the United Kingdom in June 1905.
 It is made exclusively with milk chocolate and is renowned for its smooth, creamy texture, with the original bar containing the equivalent of a glass and a half of full-cream milk in every 200 grams.
 The brand has become a market leader in the UK, consistently ranking as the best-selling chocolate bar there.
 It is available in numerous countries, including India, China, Australia, and the United States, where it is manufactured and distributed by the Hershey Company under license, though the recipe differs from the UK version.
 The chocolate is available in a wide variety of forms, including the classic bar, Caramel, Fruit & Nut, Whole Nut, Silk, Ritz, Oreo, and even a Vegemite-flavored bar launched in Australia in 2015.
 In 2024, Mondelez International, the current owner of Cadbury, celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Cadbury brand with a relaunch of seven retro limited edition packaging designs.
